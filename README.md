# Razer Battery Taskbar
## A simple electron taskbar icon for wireless device battery level.
This project is a work in progress developed mainly for personal use.

Much of this code is adapted from other works, credit below:
* OpenRazer https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer
* Hsutungyu https://github.com/hsutungyu/razer-mouse-battery-windows

## Supported Hardware
* Razer Deathadder V3 Pro (Wireless, Plugged in)

## Editing the code
The code can be edited to be used with another device by changing the addresses under the RazerProducts const in main.js to match your device. You can then use npm and electron-forge to make a new app that works with your device.
