# Razer Battery Taskbar
## Fork of https://github.com/Tekk-Know/RazerBatteryTaskbar
Only changed the taskbar icons, the way they update, and the addresses to work with my mouse. 

## Supported Hardware
* Razer Deathadder V3 Pro (Wireless, Plugged in)

## Editing the code
The code can be edited to be used with another device by changing the addresses under the RazerProducts const in main.js to match your device. You can then use npm and electron-forge to make a new app that works with your device.
